A recent study in The Journal Of Clinical Investigation found that cow meat is more likely to be contaminated with pathogens than chicken. That finding prompted researchers at Stanford University and Michigan State Health System (MSHS) School – Medical Sciences to perform tests on animals from two locations where they had previously tested feces samples taken after eating beef cattle carcasses . They uncovered evidence suggesting some animal species could also harbor bacteria resistant as well—a possible sign humans are ingesting infected foods while still alive! In addition , an experiment conducted by scientists led them toward developing new vaccines against these disease-causing microbes called "Bravia virus neutralizing antibodies." A similar vaccine has been developed using human blood cells derived form cows produced through breeding programs like FMCSA's Cattle Production Program ."  (Source ) According To
